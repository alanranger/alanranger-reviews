    body: "This is my second review: apologies if it isn't the same as the first! I thought this was a very good event in what was probably the most extensive bluebell wood I've ever visited. We were blessed with excellent weather which was a great advantage. It was also a huge advantage to have exclusive access to the wood because we didn't have to cope with members of the public wandering into our shots; also the bluebells hadn't been downtrodden. My purpose in joining was to gain access to the location which from images on the website looked (and proved to be exceptional) but for those who needed it Alan was on hand to offer help and advice. We were confined to a narrow path which occasionally made it difficult to pass other members of the group but there were only 4 of us so it wasn't much of an issue. The main problem was not knowing in advance just how extensive the woods were. This made it very tricky to time ourselves and Alan applied some pressure after the 1st hour by saying we hadn't seen a tenth of what was on offer. The net result was that I spent too long at the beginning and had to rush through at the end missing many great shots. I do not know how to solve this problem for those attending for the first time: perhaps the answer is to return next year!",

I greatly enjoyed the workshop, the small informal group, and the relaxed style of presentation. The blend of introductory theory, progressing logically to recommended/advisory camera settings; and followed by a practical session in the adjacent woodland worked well. After a refreshment break, attention turned to post production analysis of the morning woodland session. Alan was at pains to ensure that the work of everyone was given equal consideration, and we all received a copy of the suggested improvements made to our images for later review. Overall I was pleased with my first experience of Alan Ranger Photography, although my personal preparation for this workshop fell short of the ideal. I found the sessions informative and enjoyable. Alan's style encouraged participation from delegates, all of whom I found intelligent and engaging, and very willing to share their knowledge and experience, which was very helpful to me as a newcomer. I am already planning for my next workshop.",
