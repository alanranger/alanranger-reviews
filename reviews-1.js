His enthusiasm to capture images and learn photography in the most challenging conditions was infectious.   If we were unable to venture outside, we spent our time learning some extremely useful methods in Lightroom & Photoshop together with a variety of other software packages.  I would highly recommend Alan if you are wanting to not only have a great experience in stunning scenery on his workshops, but also in the classroom to improve your photography beyond expectation. You won't be disappointed.  Thank you Alan",

    "body": "After completing the beginners course, I wasn't sure what do do next, so I signed up for some 1-2-1 sessions with Alan. His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",

The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.

Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",

There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated.

If you like dramatic seascapes with a little excitement thrown in with an incoming tide, this workshop is for you. I found this workshop particularly helpful as there was plenty of opportunity to practice longer exposure techniques whilst dealing with a contrasting bright sky, white frothy sea and dark rocks.",

I accept that the event is not costly and isn\u2019t tuition-based but I\u2019m not sure we gained a lot from what we could have done ourselves. However, this may have been partly our fault as we were a small group and may not have engaged with the photography as much as we could have done.  We lost Alan in the latter part of the walk as people splintered off to take the photographs they wanted - many of those who sign up to his outdoor events I feel are seasoned photographers.  It was stated we could ask for help but I would suggest that a way to make an improvement for less experienced photographers would be for him to make a few proactive suggestions as to suitable apertures etc at the start of the walk which would make people feel they had gained something above what they could do on their own. It would also encourage them to go again. We do hope to come on another walk at some time in the future though and I would look forward to my results being rather better!",

    "body": "I have attended a couple of DSLR introduction courses in the past and have both were not particularly good. Mostly a brief overview of the non-automatic modes and then you're sent out to take pictures. What this means is you don't really learn anything. I was therefore a bit cautious about booking this one in case it was similar. It couldn't have been more different.  I recently completed the 'Get Off Auto' course as a taster session and found this to be excellent. Alan covers everything you need to known in a 2.5 hour session and rather than sending you out blindly to take photo's - these are given as exercises to complete in your own time - meaning you have more time to explore each topic and ask the questions that you really want to ask.   The first week introduction is a good starter and is the natural lead in to the 4 week beginners course.",

In the evenings we received / gave feedback on the locations as well as getting feedback on the photos we had taken during the day if wanted. It was a great group with lots of energy throughout the weekend.I have since booked a 121 to get feedback on my post processing the photos I took.",

I have used my camera off Auto many many times and have at times felt like I\u2019ll never master this!!

I found the course useful and can't wait to book myself onto one of Alans workshops so I can put into practice what he has taught on this course. Many thanks... Highly recommended.",

The information that Alan provided in advance was very comprehensive, and included not just equipment required but also advice on clothing and food and drink. Not surprisingly, the theme of the workshop was 'Autumn leaves', and Alan started by stressing the importance of composition:no matter how expensive your kit or how technically skilled you are, these are of little value if what's in the frame is not interesting. After giving us some advice and a short demonstration he sent us off for half an hour to select our subject matter.  He then provided each of us with hands on guidance on how to take the best shots from both an artistic and technical point of view.  For example, he showed me some tricks available in my camera that I didn't know existed, and I'd never realized just how beautiful an oak leaf can be. In a few hours I learned a lot about photography in general and my camera's features in particular. For me, a very successful and inspiring day.",

I've done a couple of photography workshops now, but this was the first with Alan Ranger.

It then took many attempts to find a date that worked for myself and for Alan.    The details for joining the workshop came a couple of days before the event.  It did recommend a filter that I didn't have but it was too late to buy it from Amazon.  No real problem through as we did really need it.  The first 15 minutes of the workshop were tuition and I picked up a few very useful tips from the workshop which I will use in future.  The rest of the workshop is you photograph the subject and move around the site at your own pace but not too far from the group so Alan can move around each individual and answer questions, review photos and give advice.  You are expected to ask questions and learn more that way.  I personally find that I don't think of questions until much later when the learning experience has really soaked in.  So it would have been good to stop and specifically talk about a topic.    I plan to visit the location again on a different day and try again now I have seen my photos.

    "body": "Mr Ranger took my camera off me athe beginning of my paid session and altered all my settings, even my view finder was altered to his eye.  It took me several weeks to reset my camera to my settings! The session itself was of little benefit to me, as he was more interested in three other members of the group who obviously were impressed with his constant name dropping of where his photographs had appeared.  He told us at the beginning of the day long session it was up to us to go and take photographs and then he would circulate and look at our results.  He then proceeded to wander off with his own camera and click away to his own benefit.  Yes he did come over to me once all day and went through my photos.  I found his comments unhelpful, but I guess by this time I had realised that this course and tutor was not for me.  The day could not end soon enough for me.  I would not recommend Alan Ranger as you will be wasting your money.",

What we will see, what we could be looking for to frame a shot, alternative viewpoints, what obvious mistakes to avoid. How to set up the camera, which lens, mode, exposure depth of field etc and whether there were any questions on reaching our destination. Instead on arrival Alan marched us straight to where he thought the best image was with no discussion, set up his camera and really had little by way of Q & A on site leaving everyone to pretty much get on with it. He reviewed the images captured over the evening meal and made comments by which time it was of course too late to consider changing composition or camera settings. This is learning by ones mistakes after the photographic opportunity has passed and not taking advantage of a professionals knowledge to consider how to improve whilst the opportunity is in front of you. I did ask the others on our trip how they thought the trip was going and I agreed with much of their comments which I have repeated here. I have resisted reviewing Alans trip since October 2017 as I think he believes he is doing a good job and will not be receptive to negative comments.",

Felt Alan got the balance slightly wrong on first day between leaving us to our own devices without being invasive and perhaps offering more advice/help but given his 5 hour drive and the fact all three of us said we had at least 20 years of experience I wasn\u2019t too bothered. Alan was very informative and helpful on 2nd and 3rd day with technical and artistic advice. Great locations and his knowledge of the area was very helpful in achieving some really good results which he was very helpful at dinner in giving advice on. Hands on advice of camera features and technical ideas really improved my results over the 3 days combined with being able to look through Alan\u2019s camera at his framing and his final results at the various locations. Great choice of accommodation too with enjoyable meals to start and finish the days with chance to talk through the day and plan the next.   Will definitely be going on another workshop with Alan.",

Looking forward to the remaining 4 weeks of the extended course.",

Having the feedback for your images both educational and a boost in confidence. Can't put a price on what this course has taught me. Spent my entire life taking photos, had a DSLR for over a year, and studied photography at A-Level. But I learned more about the technical side of photography in the last 5 weeks than I did in all that previous time. A perfect spring board to take my photography that step further, and hopefully allow me to do what I love for a living.

I am currently doing the practice excercises that Alan set as 'homework' and am looking forward to attending the next 4 sessions with him. I would highly recommend Alan if you are just starting out on your photography journey.

Alan has clearly a lot of passion for photography which is incredibly motivating and refreshing for someone like me who wants to get into the field and make a career through it.  I found Alan's teaching technique refreshing, not patronising and very useful. The structure was well formed and study material very useful. No question was too much for Alan and he was able to constructively break down the teaching into chunks that made sense, with some practical exercises to help elaborate.  If you're looking to get into the field of photography or just need a fresher or a point to start from, I would highly recommend this course. I'm going to also join Alan's Lightroom course and potentially a workshop in the near future.  There are flexible payment options available and I approached Alan initially to discuss my needs and he tailored a plan suitable for what I wanted to achieve.",

A lot of emphasis was placed on observation and carefully choosing and thinking about what a shot should show and say, and trying to develop an eye for an interesting picture (Rather than just point and click); we experimented with taking shots for colour, landscape vistas, and close up macro photography of leaves, flowers, and fungi.    I also learnt a lot more about what my camera can do in terms of settings, exposures, focusing and light metering. I thought I knew my camera fairly well, but now can get so much more out of it.

I found out after booking that the course was a 'lecture' format so I was a bit skeptical, thinking that I probably wouldn't learn a whole lot. I was completely wrong! Although it's not practical, it is really interactive and Alan encourages lots of participation, questions, thoughts etc. The course covers the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO etc. necessary for you to go home and experiment, knowing what all the settings on the camera dial are. Alan was very patient and didn't mind explaining numerous times what certain things are when the class for confused!

So, with not much preparation other than the informative email from Alan, off I drove to the Kenilworth session, not knowing quite what to expect. The venue was good, parking well lit and room was more than adequate. You would think that 3 hours of listening and trying to understand the very basics of photography would drag,  but actually the time went fast. Alan was knowledgeable, keen to impart that knowledge,  and all 11 of us in the room made some small or large contribution to the evening. I have come away knowing a lot more than I knew when I started, and am looking forward to recharging those camera batteries to take photographs  (not snaps!) that have been created, not snapped with hopefulness!  As a stand alone evening this was a great start. There is the opportunity to continue on the 5 week course at a discounted rate if booked on the evening, however my personal feeling was that I would prefer to start practicing with my Bridge camera before committing a further  \u00a3175 (\u00a3200 if booked after the easy photography evening).

His passion and drive and love for his craft is evident.  A highly creative and artistic eye coupled with oodles of technical know-how, acres of experience and exceptionally high standards, and you've got yourself a tutor who raises the bar and challenges you to do the same.

For me, a key thing he said was 'photographers take photographs, not cameras'. There is little point in knowing all the settings on my camera if I do not see at what is around me and create photographs that share with others what I feel about what I see.

    "body": "After completing the beginners course, I wasn't sure what do do next, so I signed up for some 1-2-1 sessions with Alan. His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",

    "body": "Just returned from an excellent workshop in the Lake District.  Alan took us to brilliant locations and made sure everyone was comfortable with both the creative aspect of 'seeing the shot' and then attempting to execute it but fortunately stopped short of taking the shot for us to ensure we really learned from the experience. The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.  The domestic arrangements were also very good with friendly staff who were not fazed by a group of photopapers with muddy boots.",

Alan drove us to some fantastic locations that I would never have found on my own. He showed us example photographs he had previously taken in the areas we visited to give us ideas for compositions. He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.  I have come back with more good photographs from one weekend trip than I would normally manage to get in a year.",

Alan provided fantastic advice and guidance throughout the workshop both technically and composition wise and provided a range of potential types of subjects.

We went to various locations so that everyone could get something including a lovely sun rise in Craster so time management was essential and Alan was flexible throughout the weekend adjusting the timetable so that we got the most out of the time we were in Northumbria. Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",

It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks",
