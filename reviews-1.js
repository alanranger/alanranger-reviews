His enthusiasm to capture images and learn photography in the most challenging conditions was infectious.   If we were unable to venture outside, we spent our time learning some extremely useful methods in Lightroom & Photoshop together with a variety of other software packages.  I would highly recommend Alan if you are wanting to not only have a great experience in stunning scenery on his workshops, but also in the classroom to improve your photography beyond expectation. You won't be disappointed.  Thank you Alan",

    "body": "After completing the beginners course, I wasn't sure what do do next, so I signed up for some 1-2-1 sessions with Alan. His expertise and constructive critique during the first session enabled him to tailor a session suitable for me for No 2. We discussed black and white photography and concentrated on editing some of my previous shots using software add-ons to the Lightroom program, which I already use. While I am by no means anywhere near expert quality, Alans teaching style has given me the confidence to take my photography to the next level. Alan offers as many 1-2-1 sessions as you feel you will need, but for me, I have chosen to use my other 2 sessions in a workshop situation, allowing me to get out and about with other photographers in the field and learn more techniques with guidance from Alan. One real positive that has come from this was an immediate solution to a problem I had been suffering with my photo editing. This was due to Lightroom being updated recently and my Mac not being able to cope. Since upgrading my RAM, following Alans recommendation, the performance and speed of my software has been much improved, allowing my to spend more time doing decent edits instead of waiting like I was before. Many thanks for all your help so far, and looking forward to the next one.",

The evening feedback sessions reviewing our shots enabled us to modify technique on the subsequent days to improve the quality of our images.  He also helped me use Christmas presents like Expodisc to great effect and navigate the menus of my new Sony camera.

He was happy to help with any questions or advice you need, but you need to ask for help if you want it, otherwise he will leave you alone to do what you want; which suited me.

Restaurant on the Friday night was a good choice, nice food, also the fish and chip shop on the Friday excellent and good prices.  Not so good - hotel looked very nice from the pictures, but hygiene was a big issue for me, mouldy bath mat which got changed once I asked, and there was mould on the shower panel it is in need of refurbishment, bedroom furniture MFI quite flimsy.  I understand why Alan has selected it as it was conveniently located but they do need to address  these issues I am sure he will feed back to them as its in an ideal location.",

    "body": "I attended one of Alan's 3 day all inclusive trips to Norfolk this September. It was extremely well organised, with a detailed itinerary which covered a huge range of locations to suit all tastes. His knowledge of the locations and where to get the best shots was excellent. The itinerary was adjusted according to the changes in weather and worked brilliantly. There was opportunity to try new techniques and creative styles with tuition or you can just do what you normally do in a beautiful place.  There were plenty of loo stops, a great B&B and some fantastic places to eat. I valued Alan's direct feedback and guidance, but he won't mince his words and will be honest and clear! Alan was always available for input but his style is not to be in your face, which our group appreciated. He is extremely knowledgable and skilled but is able to pitch things at the right level for the range of skill across the group. His good humour made the weekend great fun for all. Thanks",

    "body": "Just back from Hartland Quay workshop with Alan Ranger.  I have done a few workshops with Alan over the last couple of years but this one topped them all.  If you like dramatic seascapes with a little excitement thrown in with an incoming tide, this workshop is for you. I found this workshop particularly helpful as there was plenty of opportunity to practice longer exposure techniques whilst dealing with a contrasting bright sky, white frothy sea and dark rocks.",

There were only 3 of us, and Alan, as 2 others had had to cancel, which made for a very pleasant session. We picked up a few tips and have some interesting photos as a result. A good way to spend a morning!",
